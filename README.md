- 👋 Hi, I’m Yann Novak.
- 👀 I am a queer artist & composer.
- 🎨 My work is guided by my unique perspective as a queer autodidact. Informed by my partial color blindness and dyslexia, I uses sound and light to explore how these intangible materials can act as catalysts to focus our awareness on our own direct experience.
