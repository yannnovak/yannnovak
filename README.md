- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yann Novak.
- ðŸ‘€ I am a queer artist, composer & technologist.
- ðŸŽ¨ My work is guided by my unique perspective as a queer autodidact. Working critically with technology, I uses sound and light to explore questions of presence, agency, and technological influence, transforming these intangible materials into human-scaled encounters that blur the physical and the virtual.
